btc_python_learning
===================

learning python and bitcoin things

My main goal is to learn python and build my skills in that language.
Along the way I will be trying small experiements with some bitcoin sites
and as I build up my skills I will hopefully learn how to use 
Github along the way. 
The eventual aim is to be able to build an API to plug into the exchanges and
also a havelock API to monitor stocks and send you a simple daily email about your
portfolio. Maybe try calculate something like P/E ratios and other financial type info

This is all just for learning as I am new to python.
